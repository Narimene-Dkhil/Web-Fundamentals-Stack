# User Card Layout Assignment

### Overview

This assignment focuses on building a user card component with CSS, replicating the layout provided in the wireframe image. We will apply CSS properties such as `position`, `padding`, and `margin` to style the card and place elements, including icons, accurately.

### Objectives

The primary objectives of this assignment are:
1. **CSS Layout Styling** - Use CSS properties to create a clean, responsive layout for the user card.
2. **Positioning** - Use `position` properties like `absolute`, `relative`, or `fixed` to position the icon as shown in the wireframe.
3. **Spacing** - Use properties like `padding` and `margin` to achieve proper spacing between elements.

## **Use what we've learned about CSS to recreate this layout**
