### Buttons to Recreate
1. **Search Button**: Create a button that resembles a search button commonly seen on websites.
2. **Plus Button**: Design a circular button (using `border-radius: 50%`) that represents the "+" icon.
3. **Create Account Button**: Style a button that encourages users to create an account.

### Optional Enhancement
- **Box-Shadow**: For the "Create Account" button, experiment with the `box-shadow` property to add depth and dimension. This will enhance the visual appeal of the button.

## CSS Properties to Focus On
Here are some key properties you may find useful for your buttons:

- **Border**: Define the border style, width, and color.
- **Border-Radius**: Control the roundness of the button corners. Use `border-radius: 50%;` for circular buttons.
- **Height and Width**: Set the dimensions of the buttons according to your design.
- **Box-Shadow**: Add shadows to create a layered effect. Example:
  ```css
  box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);

- (Optional) Try applying box-shadow to the "Create Account" button
