# Video Preview

### Objectives

- Practice using `onmouseover` and `onmouseout`
- Practice working from an existing code base

For this assignment we'll be working with some existing code (find it in zipped file) to add a video in. We'll want to find a free video that we want to work with from https://www.pexels.com/videos/.  Next we'll want to add the video into a video tag in the HTML. To make the website more interactive add hover events to play and pause the video when hovering.

### Hints:
We may need to make use of the `.play()` and `.pause()` methods - reference (https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_video.asp)

We may also need the video to be `muted` as modern browsers want users to interact with (click) videos for them to start playing.

### Requirements:
- Add a `<video>` into the existing project
- When hovering the video it should preview the content by playing the video on mute

### Technologies Used
- HTML - Structure of the layout.
- CSS - Styling to match the wireframe.
- JavaScript - Functions for button interactivity.
