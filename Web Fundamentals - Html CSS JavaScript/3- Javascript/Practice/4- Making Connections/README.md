# Making Connections

### Objectives

- Add JavaScript functionality to a previous assignment
- Use JavaScript to remove elements from the webpage

We've spent a lot of time working on some past projects and that hard work is something we can reuse. Let's return to the Profile Page assignment and add the types of JavaScript functionality we've previously learned onto it!

If we weren't happy with how ours turned out then feel free to use the already completed **HTML** and **CSS** code ( you can see it in zipped file).
