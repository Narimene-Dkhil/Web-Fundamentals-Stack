# FizzBuzz Challenge

## Overview

FizzBuzz is a classic coding challenge often used to assess knowledge of loops and conditionals. In this challenge, you will write a program that iterates through numbers 1 to 100, applying specific conditions to print certain outputs based on the numberâ€™s divisibility.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this assignment are to:
1. Practice using **loops** and **conditionals**.
2. Implement logic to handle divisibility checks.
3. Produce the correct outputs according to the FizzBuzz rules.

A short segment should look like:

```
1
2
"Fizz"
4
"Buzz"
"Fizz"
7
8
"Fizz"
"Buzz"
11
"Fizz"
13
14
"FizzBuzz"
```


## Requirements

Your code should:
- Print `"Fizz"` for each number that is a multiple of 3.
- Print `"Buzz"` for each number that is a multiple of 5.
- Print `"FizzBuzz"` for each number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5.
- Print the number itself if it does not meet any of the above conditions.
- 
**Hint:** We may need to make use of the modulo operator a % b

## Technologies Used
